# ITVB23OWS

Repository for ITVB23OWS [Development Pipelines](https://github.com/hanze-hbo-ict/itvb23ows-starter-code) at Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

## Installation

Using a PHP 5.6 or higher web server, run the following command in the directory containing index.php:

```sh
php -S localhost:8000
```

In addition to PHP 5.6 or higher, the code requires the mysqli extension and a MySQL
or compatible server. The application assumes a root user without password, and tries
to access the database `hive`. The file `hive.sql` contains the database schema.
